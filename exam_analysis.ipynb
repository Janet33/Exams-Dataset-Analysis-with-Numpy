# Let’s say: The dataset represents a gradebook, containing students’ exam grades in a particular class. 
# The protocol is that when a student doesn’t make up an exam they missed, their missing grade needs to be replaced with a zero at the end of the term. 
# If you noticed any missing exam grades in the dataset, replace them with zeros, to reflect the class protocol. Make sure to finish this before proceeding.
